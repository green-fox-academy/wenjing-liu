the departments provided the data in different formats. You task is to
standardize and store them in database. Then you need to answer the following
questions:

- Which first name is the most common in the company?
- Which first name is the most common among the younger (<30) employees?
- What is the median salary in the company?
- How many employee earns more than the average?
  - do not hard-code the average

median
