We will be building a dataset for a simple comparison tool today.

The aim is to provide a simple way to compare laptops, their prices in different stores.

First part:

Alza.co.uk is an online store predominantly offering electronics and home appliances. Your task is to get the names of the best three laptops in each of these three categories - home and office, gaming, professional, their previous and current price (if the type is not on sale, the price will be the same).

Second part:

Find another website of your choice, from which you can scrape products for comparison. Repeat the process from teh first part.

Third part:

Try to come up with a way how to connect results from both of your datasets so that you can compare prices of a given product in the two stores.

These excercises might get a bit challenging and time consuming, so it might be that you only finish first two parts.
