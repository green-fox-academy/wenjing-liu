Task 2: FBiking LA

This task is pretty open and it is supposed to make you look at the "business" problem.
You were approached by a city transportation planning team (in this case Los Angeles). They are running a network of bikesharing stations and are looking into how to plan investments fand changes for the year 2018 (the data is for 2016/17).
You are supposed to provide materials for them to have better understanding of how people use the network and if they should think about changing the subscription plans.

1. Define, what metrics should the organization be looking at. Why would you choose those? Think of:
        - Do you see differences in some districts, etc.?
        - Do you see any time-based trends in usage?
        - Any differences between the different users based on subscriptions?
        - Any stations with heavy usage which might require additional care?
2. Take the Los Angeles Metro Bike Share Trip dataset from kaggle as your source, load it into Qlik Sense and run the analysis.
