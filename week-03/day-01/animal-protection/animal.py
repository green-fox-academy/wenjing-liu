#### Animal

- It must have `name` and stores it's `healthState` (true or false) and a `healCost`.
- It must have a method named `heal()`, that sets the `isHealthy` field's status to true
- It must have a method named `isAdoptable` that returns a boolean value whether it can be adopted or not     - an animal can be adopted if it is healthy
- It must have a method named `toString()` that represents the Animal in the following format:

```
<name> is not healthy (<heal cost>â‚¬), and not adoptable
<name> is healthy, and adoptable
```

*The animal's name is the same as the class name by default, but it can be set trough constructor as well*
