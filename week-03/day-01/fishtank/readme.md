### Fish tank

Now you are going to create a simple aquarium where you can take care of your fishes.

#### Fish

Each fish has a name, weight and a color

- The fish has a status method it should print the status for a fish.
  - e.g.: `Dory, weight: 9, color: blue, short-term memory loss: true`
- The fish has an abstract feed method

**You can't instantiate a Fish**

##### Clownfish

Clownfish, gains 1 gramm when feeded and has stripe color.

##### Tang

Tang, gains 1 gramms when feeded and can suffer short-term memory loss.

##### Kong

Koi, gains 2 gramms when feeded.

#### Aquarium

- Create a method where you can add fishes to the aquarium.
- Create a method on the aquarium that feeds all the fishes in the aquarium:
  - increases the weight of every fish with the amount of gramms they gain when feeded.
- Create a method on the aquarium that removes the big fishes: 
  - A big fish's weight is at least 11 gramms.
- The aquarium has a status method it should print the status for each fish.
