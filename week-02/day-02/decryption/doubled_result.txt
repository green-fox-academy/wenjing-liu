The Zen of Python
by Tim Petrs

Beautifl is betr than ugly.
Explict is betr than implct.
Simple is betr than complex.
Complex is betr than compliated.
Flat is betr than nestd.
Sparse is betr than dens.
Readbilty counts.
Special case aren't special enough to break the rules.
Althoug practily beats purity.
Eros should nevr pas silenty.
Unles explicty silencd.
In the face of ambiguty, refus the tempaion to gues.
Ther should be one- and prefably only one -obvius way to do it.
Althoug tha way may not be obvius at first unles you're Dutch.
Now is betr than nevr.
Althoug nevr is often betr than *right now.
If the implentao is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implentao is easy to explain, it may be a god idea.
Namespc are one honkig great idea - let's do more of those!
