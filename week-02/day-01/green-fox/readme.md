## Person

Create a `Person` class with the following fields:
 -  `name`: the name of the person
 -  `age`: the age of the person (whole number)
 -  `gender`: the gender of the person (male / female)

And the following methods:
 -  `introduce()`: prints out "Hi, I'm `name`, a `age` year old `gender`."
 -  `get_goal()`: prints out "My goal is: Live for the moment!"

And the following constructors:
 -  `Person(name, age, gender)`
 -  `Person()`: sets `name` to Jane Doe, `age` to 30, `gender` to female

## Student

Create a `Student` class that has the same fields and methods as the `Person` class, and has the following additional

     -  `introduce()`: "Hi, I'm `name`, a `age` year old `gender` from `previous_organization` who skipped `skipped_days` days from the course already."
     -  `skip_days(number_of_days)`: increases `skipped_days` by `number_of_days`

The `Student` class has the following constructors:
 -  `Student(name, age, gender, previous_organization)`: beside the given parameters, it sets `skipped_days` to 0
 -  `Student()`: sets `name` to Jane Doe, `age` to 30, `gender` to female, `previous_organization` to The School of Life, `skipped_days` to 0

## Mentor

Create a `Mentor` class that has the same fields and methods as the `Person` class, and has the following additional
 -  fields:
     -  `level`: the level of the mentor (junior / intermediate / senior)
 -  methods:
     -  `get_goal()`: prints out "Educate brilliant junior software developers."
     -  `introduce()`: "Hi, I'm `name`, a `age` year old `gender` `level` mentor."

The `Mentor` class has the following constructors:
 -  `Mentor(name, age, gender, level)`
 -  `Mentor()`: sets `name` to Jane Doe, `age` to 30, `gender` to female, `level` to intermediate

## Sponsor

Create a `Sponsor` class that has the same fields and methods as the `Person` class, and has the following additional

     -  `hire()`: increase `hired_students` by 1
     -  `get_goal()`: prints out "Hire brilliant junior software developers."


The `Sponsor` class has the following constructors:
 -  `Sponsor(name, age, gender, company)`: beside the given parameters, it sets `hired_students` to 0
 -  `Sponsor()`: sets `name` to Jane Doe, `age` to 30, `gender` to female, `company` to Google and `hired_students` to 0

## Cohort

Create a `Cohort` class that has the following
 -  fields:
     -  `name`: the name of the cohort
     -  `students`: a list of `Student`s
     -  `mentors`: a list of `Mentor`s
 -  methods:
     -  `add_student(Student)`: adds the given `Student` to `students` list
     -  `add_mentor(Mentor)`: adds the given `Mentor` to `mentors` list
     -  `info()`: prints out "The `name` cohort has `len(students)` students and `len(mentors)` mentors."

The `Cohort` class has the following constructors:
 -  `Cohort(name)`: beside the given parameter, it sets `students` and `mentors` as empty lists

## Test input

```python
people = []

mark = Person('Mark', 46, 'male')
people.append(mark)
jane = Person()
people.append(jane)
john = Student('John Doe', 20, 'male', 'BME')
people.append(john)
student = Student()
people.append(student)
gandhi = Mentor('Gandhi', 148, 'male', 'senior')
people.append(gandhi)
mentor = Mentor()
people.append(mentor)
sponsor = Sponsor()
elon = Sponsor('Elon Musk', 46, 'male', 'SpaceX')
people.append(elon)
student.skip_days(3)

for i in range(5):
    elon.hire()

for i in range(3):
    sponsor.hire()

for person in people:
    person.introduce()
    person.get_goal()

awesome = LagopusClass('AWESOME')
awesome.add_student(student);
awesome.add_student(john);
awesome.add_mentor(mentor);
awesome.add_mentor(gandhi);
awesome.info();
```
